    <h1>Paksiw na Pata</h1>

    <img src="../img/paksiwpata.jpg" alt="delicious pork pata dish">

    <p>Paksiw na Pata is pork hock cooked in vinegar and soy sauce . Although the term “Paksiw” means cooking in vinegar and garlic, the soy sauce is added to bring additional flavor and color.  A bit of sugar and banana blossoms are also incorporated into the dish.</p>
    <p>This dish somewhat resembles <a href="./adobo.html">Pork Adobo</a>, which is considered as one of the most popular Filipino dishes. </p>

    <p>I like this dish for its simplicity. In addition, I enjoy the way the pork fat melts in my mouth in every bite. I thin that tenderizing the meat until it almost separates from the bone really does the trick.</p>
