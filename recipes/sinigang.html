    <h1>Pork Sinigang with Gabi</h1>

    <img src="../img/Sinigangbaboygabi.jpg" alt="Steaming pork sinigang dish">

    <p>Sinigang na baboy with Gabi is a Filipino pork soup with taro cooked in a sour broth. Sinigang is my comfort food, and one of the first few dishes that I tried to make way back when I was starting to learn how to cook.</p>
    <p>Any cut of pork can be used to cook sinigang na baboy. There are no restrictions. In fact, the most tasty sinigang na baboy is made using pork neck bones. Other common cuts of pork that can be used to make this dish are pork shoulder, picnic ham, and pork loin. </p>

    <p>The most important thing to consider in making sinigang dishes is the level of sourness of the soup. There are many ingredients that you can use to make this dish sour. Traditional ingredients are unripe tamarind, bilimbi (kamias), and guava. The latter will provide a mild level of sourness. Personally, I like mine very sour and I discovered that using “sinigang sa sampaloc mix” provides just the right level of sour that I want. It also saves me time.

    <p>When is sinigang na baboy best eaten? It can be anytime you crave for it. However, I like it better for dinner especially when the weather is cold or if it is rainy (or snowy for that matter). Having sinigang makes me feel warm and toasty.</p>
